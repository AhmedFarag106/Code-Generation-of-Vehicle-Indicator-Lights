# Code Generation of Vehicle Indicator Lights

## Overview
This project delved into Model-Based Systems Engineering, focusing on the development of a system inspired by vehicle lights indicators. The process involved various stages, including defining requirements, building a Simulink model, conducting Model-in-the-Loop Testing, generating C code for an ARM target, configuring HAL and MCAL layers, and validating the system through Back-to-Back Testing and simulation in Proteus.

## Key Steps
- **1- Defining Requirements:** Setting system requirements using a combination of a Requirement Table and the Simulink Requirement Editor.
- **2- Constructing the Simulink Model:** Creating a controller model in Simulink and simulating it to ensure proper functionality.
- **3- MIL Testing:** Conducting Model-in-the-Loop Testing with Simulink Test Manager, including the addition of relevant test cases connected to requirements.
- **4- Code Generation:** Generating C code for an ARM target using Embedded Coder.
- **5- Back-to-Back Testing:** Performing Back-to-Back Testing using Simulink Test Manager.
- **6- Developing HAL and MCAL Layers:** Configuring HAL and MCAL Layers for the STM32F103 board with Cube MX.
- **7- Simulation:** Utilizing Proteus for virtual testing and validation, mimicking real-world scenarios.
